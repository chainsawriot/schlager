To many roads, dead-end streets.
I lost my way endlessly
Looking for something to restore my faith
And give me the strength to fight again
To many words hit me hard
Coz' they never meant what they said they would
I have been taken, and broken, abandoned alone
I guess I was resigned to give in
Bridge
The very first time that we met I knew
I believed in you
I was lost and you gave me direction again, yeh

Chorus
Just when all hope had gone
Just when i needed someone to give me love
You came and rescued me, yeh
You showed me right there
Just what I've been waiting for
Lifted me up
Guided me out from the dark
Just when i needed it most you show me The Meaning of Love
As tears go by, I can say
There's nothing i miss by the crying game
My heart beats like it's still reeling
I know i can feel it
I've got the strength to fight again
Bridge
The very first time that we met I knew
I believed in you
I was lost and you gave me direction again, yeh
Chorus
Just when all hope had gone
Just when i needed someone to give me love
You came and rescued me, yeh
You showed me right there
Just what I've been waiting for
Lifted me up
Guided me out from the dark
Just when i needed it most you show me The Meaning of Love
Get a zoom on my face
Standing here, crooked smile you put it there
There's no doubt in my mind
Now you've found me I'm whole again
Chorus
Just when all hope had gone
Just when i needed someone to give me love
You came and rescued me, yeh
You showed me right there
Just what I've been waiting for
Lifted me up
Guided me out from the dark
Just when i needed it most you showed me The Meaning of Love
Just when i needed it most you showed me The Meaning of Love
Just when i needed it most you showed me The Meaning of Love
