You worry about today or tomorrow
What can you change
With all your worries?
Where are your dreams?
Where are the moments?
Let’s run away
Or is this the end?
Come on, let's go
Watching sunsets together
Yes, I've had enough
Everything else is like self-deception
Miles and miles, with you on the beach
Miles and miles, always along
Just like one heart
Cardiac arrest
Miles and miles, alone with you
Even if the sun doesn‘t shine

Our hearts are united
A 1000 times and though 1000 nights
We live our dreams eternally
A 1000 times, will you be with me
And the two of us will never be alone
Alone
Never alone again
Alone
Never alone again
I know you've got doubts
You can turn it down
How will you know
If we succeed
If you don‘t come along
You will always ask yourself
Would it have worked out
Then I could tell you:
Come on, let's go
Watching sunsets together
Yes, I’m sick and tired
Everything else is like self-deception
Miles and miles, with you on the beach
Miles and miles, always along
Just like one heart
Cardiac arrest
Miles and miles, alone with you
Even if the sun doesn‘t shine
Our hearts are united
A 1000 times and though 1000 nights
We live our dreams eternally
A 1000 times, will you be with me
And the two of us will never be alone
Alone
Never alone again
Alone
Never alone again
Miles and miles, with you on the beach
Miles and miles, always along
Just like one heart
Cardiac arrest
Miles and miles, alone with you
Even if the sun doesn‘t shine
Never alone again
