I'm lost, I'm falling deep
Curse yourself and all the spirits that I called
A stab in her heart, you are with her
And a thousand lights are burning in me
But I'll smile when you go
If you are standing in front of the shards
Even my heart is seriously injured
I will dance until last
I'll smile when you go
I do not care where you sleep today

Even though I can not breathe now
I'll forget you anyway
It was a rush, it's over
Say, do you really think I'll forgive you again '
There is no happy ending for us
Because my big love is with another
But I'll smile when you go
If you are standing in front of the shards
But I'll fly, soon fall in love again
Hope remains and wounds heals the time
But I'll smile when you go
If you are standing in front of the shards
