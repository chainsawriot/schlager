The sun that falls around your face is warm and light
Again we fall asleep and turn the day to night
We've been through oh so many things
The good and bad, we didn't have a ring
Sometimes you don't, don't have to wear a ring
And we didn't say yes but I know I have
Everything I need
Never changed my name but still I am blessed
'Everything I need
Now I'd say "I do" if you ever ask
But until then I know what I have
Everything I have's
Everything I need

Sometimes I think and wonder what I look like dressed in white
But then I know the way it is, it feels so right
We belong, that I always knew
For those who want, they can say "I do"
Sometimes you don't, don't have to say "I do"
And we didn't say yes but I know I have
Everything I need
Never changed my name but still I am blessed
'Everything I need
Now I'd say "I do" if you ever ask
But until then I know what I have
Everything I have's
Everything I need
Words have no meaning, it's what I am feeling
Love is much more than a ring
And we didn't say yes but I know I have
Everything I need
Never changed my name but still I am blessed
'Everything I need
Now I'd say "I do" if you ever ask
but until then I know what I have
Everything I have's
Everything I need
