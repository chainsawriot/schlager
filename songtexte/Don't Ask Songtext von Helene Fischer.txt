Wake up my friend
Now it's time again
Yes it's time to leave this feeling and go back to something else
And don't think twice
Now I'll pay the price
Because I know some dreams are not meant to be held
Now don't ask me when
You'll see me again
If you love me you will find a way
Now don't ask me when
How can I pretend
Cause I gave my heart, my life away
So please handle it with care
As if I were really there

I wish I knew
How to get to you
I don't want to have to ask you
If you say that you can't stay
The moon is gone
Time to move along
And I'll see you in another life and place
Now don't ask me when
You'll see me again
If you love me you will find a way
Now don't ask me when
How can I pretend
Cause I gave my heart, my life away
So please handle it with care
As if I were really there
Now don't ask me when
You'll see me again
If you love me you will find a way
Now don't ask me when
How can I pretend
Cause I gave my heart, my life away
Now don't ask me when
You'll see me again
If you love me you will find a way
Now don't ask me when
How can I pretend
Cause I gave my heart, my life away
So please handle it with care
As if I were really there
So please handle it with care
As if I were really there
