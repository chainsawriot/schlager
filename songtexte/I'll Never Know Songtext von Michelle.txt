There is nothing more to do
There are days for loving you
I'll never know, no I'll never know
Oh what a world it would be like
To sit with you and talk all night
I'll never know, no I'll never know
Coz I've always held you so close
Now I'm losing everything I love and more
Tell me how I'm gonna wake up
What am I supposed to do
Tell me when the night is over will I still be with you
Baby if we're gonna breakup
I'll never believe it's true
(ad lib coz I'm lonely)
Tell me how I'm gonna wakeup without you

I will toss and turn at night
Dreaming what it would be like
I'll never know, no I'll never know
Maybe you would think it to
Loosing me like I lost you
But I'll never know, now I'll never know
How I'll never look at your eyes
Just to have you here beside me one more time
Tell me how I'm gonna wake up
What am I supposed to do
Tell me when the night is over will I still be with you
Baby if we're gonna break up
I'll never believe it's true
Tell me how I'm gonna wake up without you.
I wanna hear your love
Is there anybody listening
How did you hear this love
Is the sound of your heart beating next to mine
I just can't be here without you
If only I knew what you were thinking
