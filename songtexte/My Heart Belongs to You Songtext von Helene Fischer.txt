So wild and free the day you came into my life
Then tenderly I saw an angel in your eyes
And I felt your heart was beating with every beat of mine
A moment gone, and I was lost in time
My heart belongs to you
Now I know it's true
I can't help getting lost inside this feeling
My heart belongs to you
What I speak is true
My life, my heart belongs to you
I feel no doubt, I know the words I have to say
We will go on, until forever has no days
'Cause I know what your heart feels with every beat of mine
And what we have will last beyond all time

My heart belongs to you
Now I know it's true
I can't help getting lost inside this feeling
My heart belongs to you
What I speak is true
My life, my heart belongs to you
Ohhh ohhh
So deep inside I'm feeling, it's something deep within
I can feel this love we have begin
My heart belongs to you
Now I know it's true
I can't help getting lost inside this feeling
My heart belongs to you
What I speak is true
My life, my heart belongs to you
My life, my heart belongs to you
