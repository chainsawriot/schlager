I feel as if my heart could dance
Up to the stars, ascend
Where the air is so clear
You hold me close all through night
The magic feels so right
It's like heaven is here
I see a rainbow in in the sky
And though it's dark outside
You taught me how
Each time I know that you are near
It's like heaven is here
And I - I know that this is where I've never been
Now it's so clear
I fly on clouds upon the the wind
It's like heaven is here
And I - I found your hand though I couldn't understand
How close, how near
The day you came into my life
It's like heaven is here

Now I woke up from my pain
And I could breathe again
All my senses were there
I'm through with wearing only black
My laughter has come back
Because heaven is here
Now you're my lighthouse in the dark
Just like the missing part
That I so need
Since I surrendered all my fears
It's like heaven is here
And I - I know that this is where I've never been
Now it's so clear
I fly on clouds upon the the wind
It's like heaven is here
And I - I found your hand though I couldn't understand
How close, how near
The day you came into my life
It's like heaven is here
And I - I know that this is where I've never been
Now it's so clear
I fly on clouds upon the the wind
It's like heaven is here
And I - I found your hand though I couldn't understand
How close, how near
The day you came into my life
It's like heaven is here
It's like heaven is here
