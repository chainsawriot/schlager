This time yesterday,
I thought I was gonna die,
Standing at the edge,
Of my ordinary life.
Now I'm looking far ahead,
I only see clear blue skies,
I hope this feeling lasts,
Until the end of the time.
[Bridge]
Now I don't see the things that bring me down, like I used to (no),
There were times I felt like giving up, but we came through
[Chorus]
All this time, we've come a long long way,
I waited a life time for today,
I'm praying this moment's here to stay,
All this time, when everyone else said I was wrong,
You gave me a reason to be strong,
You gave me the will to carry on,
All this time

I kiss(?) my moods away,
Yesterday's far behind,
All these clouds have died,
A crater on my mind,
I was looking far ahead,
I'm looking with brand new eyes,
Well, I can't see the future,
But I know it's looking bright,
[Bridge 2]
Never thought we could survive, but we've come through (no),
There were times we felt like giving up, but we held through
[Chorus]
All this time, we've come a long long way,
I waited a life time for today,
I'm praying this moment's here to stay,
All this time, when everyone else said I was wrong,
You gave me a reason to be strong,
You gave me the will to carry on,
All this time
It's like a second chance at life,
So many people passing by,
And you know it's a shame,
'Cause they can't believe,
So they don't and they won't even try,
With every battle that's been won,
With every little thing I've done,
But I couldn't see, it's not clear to me,
All this time, we've come a long long way,
I waited a life time for today, I'm praying this moment's here to stay...
All this time, we've come a long long way,
I waited a life time for today,
I'm praying this moment's here to stay,
All this time, when everyone else said I was wrong,
You gave me a reason to be strong,
You gave me the will to carry on,
All this time
