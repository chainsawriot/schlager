Finally you Lyrics
tell me where have you been so long
I was looking for you
thread in icy
believed a false prophet
and often lost my way
could not find you
my dreams were lost
my wings too heavy
believe in the great love
I could almost not there already more
Refr.:

finally you
you and me
missed you too long
because at last you
you and me
that's really the biggest for me
now you're there
and hold me tight
even if the world drops me
with you is never a dream too far
Come carry me up to the edge of time
I was lost alone in the labyrinth
from roaring seas
you have my heart found
return it never
it shall be yours
let me finally float again
you are my eternity
I know no one is undendlich, but remains the great love
Refr.:
finally you
you and me
love you much too long
missing
because at last you
you and me
that's really the biggest for me
now you're here and hold me down
even if the world drops me
with you is never a dream too far
Come carry me up to the edge of time
finally you
you and me
missed you too long
simply because you
you and me
that's really the biggest for me
finally you
you and me
missed you too long
because at last you
you and me
that's really the biggest for me
now you're here and hold me tight
even if the world drops me
with you is never a dream too far
Come carry me up to the edge of time
finally you
you and me
