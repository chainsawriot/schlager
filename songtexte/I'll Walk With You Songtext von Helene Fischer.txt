I can feel something I know that you're hurting so deep inside
It's hard to be open when all that you hope for just seems to die
Sometimes the world can be cold
Sometimes a heart turns to stone
I'll go wherever you go, you're not alone
I'll walk with you, I'll walk with you
I will be here, so strong and clear
I will be here, be far or near
I'll walk with you, I'll walk with you
Let my love in and be your guide
I 'll be right by your side

I know the feeling when all you believe in you know is gone
Nothing but sorrow you think of tomorrow, you can't go on
Life can be sweet as a rose
Life can be hard on your own
I'll go wherever you go, you're not alone
I'll walk with you, I'll walk with you
I will be here, so strong and clear
I will be here, be far or near
I'll walk with you, I'll walk with you
Let my love in and be your guide
I 'll be right by your side
I can help you fly, bring your dreams to life
And I will be here by your side
I'll walk with you, I'll walk with you
I will be here, so strong and clear
I will be here, be far or near
I'll walk with you, I'll walk with you
Let my love in and be your guide
I 'll be right by your side
I will be here by your side
