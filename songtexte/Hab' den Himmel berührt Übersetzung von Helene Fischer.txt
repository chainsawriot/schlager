I danced totally lightly in your arms
Forgotten is the fear
I risked everything
I let sunlight through the window
Believe what the day is promising
I moved the heavens
Saw the rainbows at night
I learned that from you
The world is beautiful
Totally doesn't matter what happens tomorrow
I moved the heavens

So free alone I lost myself like a child
Who loses its way
I'm flying on clouds with the wind
I moved the heavens
So free through the dark shadows you hand
Led me into the light
Because I found my life again
I moved the heavens
I was awakened out of my pain
Time made me strong
And ensnared the meaning
I'm taking off the black clothes
With you I'm at home
I moved the heavens
You're my lighthouse in the night
What would I be without you
You are my way
Totally doesn't matter what happens tomorrow
I moved the heavens
So free alone I lost myself like a child
Who loses its way
I'm flying on clouds with the wind
I moved the heavens
So free through the dark shadows you hand
Led me into the light
Because I found my life again
I moved the heavens
