We flew just like two birds up to the stars
As we left it all behind
We were lost inside the climb
It wasn't what I planned on from the start
I was scared of the fall
So afraid to give my all
But you came over me like thunder
You showed me what I have deep inside
You let me shine the way I am
Let me be because you seem to understand
I'll stay right here
So free, 'cause I
I can cry, I can laugh
And I'll never have to mask
The way I am, you let me shine

I say exactly how I think it is
Speak the truth and go my way
Not afraid to make mistakes
I want the world to be a better place
In my heart, through my eyes
Honesty, no compromise
You let me see that I'm a dreamer
You show me what I have deep inside
You let me shine the way I am
Let me be because you seem to understand
I'll stay right here
So free, 'cause I
I can cry, I can laugh
And I'll never have to mask
The way I am, you let me shine
You'll never have to worry
It's here I want to rest
It's here I learned how I can give my best
You let me shine the way I am
Let me be because I know you understand
I'll stay right here
So free, 'cause I
I can cry, I can laugh
And I'll never have to mask
The way I am, you let me shine
The way I am, you let me shine
Aah, let me shine - you let me shine
