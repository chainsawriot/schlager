You turn and walk away
The wind is cold, so cold today
But I know that you'll return
It's one thing that I've learned
To listen to my heart when it believes
The night is endless now
But I'll be strong, you showed me how
Before I let you go,
The world I used to know
You gave me all the hope I need

Goodbye my love until we meet again
I know that you must go it's not the end
May happiness be yours along the way
And where you go may love be yours each day
My love I know you have to say farewell
I'll be alright now I know time will tell
One day you will return I don't know when
Goodbye my love until we meet again
The light of spring comes soon
Beneath the snow a flower blooms
Before that time has dawned
I'll hold you in my arms
I know that you'll be back one day
Goodbye my love until we meet again
I know that you must go it's not the end
May happiness be yours along the way
And where you go may love be yours each day
My love I know you have to say farewell
I'll be alright now I know time will tell
One day you will return I don't know when
Goodbye my love until we meet again
Goodbye my love until we meet again
