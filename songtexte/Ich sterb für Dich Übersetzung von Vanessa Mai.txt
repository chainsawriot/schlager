You know it's all so cold and so empty
So completely without you
Believe me, it's all so empty and so hard
So completely without you
And continued since you
I do not actually clear
As sleep tight it was us two already
I miss you
Yes I love you
Solang hits my heart
And if I die
I'll die for you
And when I wine
I crying about you
And when I think
I am thinking of you
It hurts so bad
Without you

Do you know that you and me
Yes that was just royally
Believe me that with you and me
Yes I swear
Was so great for me
And if we believe
Yes I have it figured
the world stands still
If you lose the knife
I miss you
Yes I love you
Solang hits my heart
And if I die
I'll die for you
And when I wine
I crying about you
And when I think
I am thinking of you
It hurts so bad
Without you
I'll die for you
I crying about you
I am thinking of you
I crying about you
And if I die
I'll die for you
And when I wine
I crying about you
And when I think
I am thinking of you
It hurts so bad
Without you
