The Rose(Live) - Helene Fischer
Some say love it is a river
人说爱如河
That drowns the tender reed
能没芦苇
Some say love it is a razor
人说爱如刀
That leaves your soul to bleed
能泣灵魂
Some say love it is a hunger
人说爱是如此焦渴
An endless aching need
即使疼痛也无法自拔
I say love it is a flower
我说爱如花
And you it's only seed
唯你能使之绽放
It's the heart afraid of breaking
心恐破碎
That never learns to dance

毋宁静止
It's the dream afraid of waking
梦恐惊醒
That never takes the chance
故此沉睡
It's the one who won't be taken
人怕无我
Who cannot seem to give
则恐付出
And the soul afraid of dying
灵魂恐死去
That never learns to live
故不学生存
And the night has been too lonely
当夜寂无人
And the road has been too long.
当道阻且长
And you think that love is only
当你说爱独一
For the lucky and the strong.
也仅给幸运与内心强大之人时
Just remember in the winter
只需知
Far beneath the bitter snow
在冬日白雪下
Lies the seed that with the sun's love'
一颗种子，静静生长
In the spring' becomes a rose
待于春日开放
