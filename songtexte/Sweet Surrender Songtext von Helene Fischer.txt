Now I wondered where I was going to
Direction in the darkness until I saw you
Every time I look and I see your light
I can't give up 'cause you're my life
Sweet surrender, now it's all that I can I feel
Sweet surrender, this time I know it's real
And like in a wonder my heart was born again
I'm not afraid to give you everything
Cause that's what sweet surrender means
Gone are all my doubts, gone is yesterday
I no longer want to turn and walk away
Sometimes I was lost I didn't see the signs
But now I'm found because you're mine

Sweet surrender now it's all that I can I feel
Sweet surrender, this time I know it's real
And like a wonder my heart was born again
I'm not afraid to give you everything
Cause that's what sweet surrender means
I almost feel ashamed, my heart, my everything
My weaknesses are there to see
But I don't care at all, I'll show you how I fall
Cause I know that it has to be
Sweet surrender now it's all that I can I feel
Sweet surrender, this time I know it's real
And like a wonder my heart was born again
I 'm not afraid to give you everything
Cause that's what sweet surrender means
