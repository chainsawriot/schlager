Am I really here, is this really happening
Cause I've thought about this moment all my life
When you pull me near, just a touch and I begin
To know I'm in the perfect place in perfect time
It's almost like I'm dreaming wide-awake
You only ever get to feel this way
Once in a lifetime
You find yourself believing
Every dream that you've lost has been found
Once in a lifetime
Somebody turns your whole world around
And my once in a lifetime is now
If you could hear my heart
You would know with every beat
Nothing I have ever done compares to this
Stay right where you are, close enough to hear me breathe
Wanna hold on to this feeling and never forget

That I am yours with every breathe I take
You only ever get to feel this way
Once in a lifetime
You find yourself believing
Every dream that you've lost has been found
Once in a lifetime
Somebody turns your whole world around
And my once in a lifetime is now
I wish that time was standing still
That I could stay right here until
I've memorized this moment here with you
Cause with every touch and every kiss
I know that I was made for this
You only find something so true
Once in a lifetime, in a lifetime
You find yourself believing every dream that you've lost has been found
Once in a lifetime
Somebody turns your whole world around
And my once in a lifetime is now
And my once in a lifetime is now
Is now
