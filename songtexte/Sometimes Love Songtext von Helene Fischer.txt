Hmmmm ooooh oooh oooooh
Sometimes love just seems to come and go, baby
Where it falls now no one seems to know, baby
And no matter what you try to do
It just comes over you
Sometimes love just seems to come and go, baby
Burning like a flame and moving slow, baby
When it does and everything is clear
Where do we go from here
I need to find an answer
All in a moment you're everything to me
You're like a shelter in the storm, baby
And you're the reason that I want to be
But then again love has no guarantee

Sometimes love just turns around and goes, baby
Sometimes it takes off and no one knows, baby
Sometimes I'm afraid that I'll loose you
Tell me what to do
Please help me understand it
All in a moment you're everything to me
You're like a shelter in the storm, baby
And you're the reason that I want to be
But then again love has no guarantee
Let's sieze the day - sieze the day
We'll go through this together now everything's alright
Staight ahead 'cause there's no end in sight
Sometimes love just seems to come and go, baby
Sometimes dreams are bigger than we know, baby
Sometimes I just need to know in time
Is tomorrow mine
Is tomorrow mine
Is tomorrow mine
