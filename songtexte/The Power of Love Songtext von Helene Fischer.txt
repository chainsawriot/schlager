The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
lost is how i, m feeling, lying in your arms
when the world outsides to much to take
that all ends when i, m with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
but never wonder where I am

'Cause I am always by your side
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
we, re heading for something
somewhere i, ve never been
sometimes i am frightened but i, m ready to learn
bout the power of love
Ooh The power of love
The power of love
sometimes i am frightened but i, m ready to learn
bout the power of love
