It's the end of something perfect
A day I face alone
I didn't see it coming
Just like the great unknown
Never thought it'd happen
'Cause we were holding tight
But it slipped away, we were both too sure when
It wasn't right
From here til forever to a place in the sun
We dreamed we could make it but the truth woke us up
Still I want you and I need you
If it's love at any cost
I'll go here til forever
If with you I get lost - I'm lost

You ask way too many questions
When it's doubt they bring
Why do you want the answers
If they don't mean a thing
Now it's time for sailing
It's time to gamble high
And it's straight ahead
Never turning back
Now I'll tell you why
From here til forever to a place in the sun
We dreamed we could make it but the truth woke us up
Still I want you and I need you
If it's love at any cost
I'll go here til forever
If with you I get lost - I'm lost
From here til forever to a place in the sun
We dreamed we could make it but the truth woke us up
Still I want you and I need you
If it's love at any cost
I'll go here til forever
If with you I get lost - I'm lost
Now I'm lost with you
And I'm lost with you
