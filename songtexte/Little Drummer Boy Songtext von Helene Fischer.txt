1.Come they told me, parapapampam,
a new born King to see, parapapampam,
our finest gifts we'll bring, parapapampam,
to lay befor a king, parapapampam, rapapampam, rapapampam.
So to honour Him, parapapampam, when we come.

2.Little baby, parapapampam,
I am a poor girl too, parapapampam,
I have no gifts to bring, parapapampam,
thats it to give the king, parapapampam, rapapampam, rapapampam.
Shall I play for you, parapapampam, on my drum?
3.Marry nodded, parapapampam,
the ox and lend kept time, parapapampam,
I played my drum for him, parapapampam,
I played my best for him, parapapampam, rapapampam, rapapampam.
Then he smiled at me, parapapampam,
me and my drum.
