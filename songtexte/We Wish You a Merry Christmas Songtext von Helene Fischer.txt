We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year

Now bring us some figgy pudding,
Now bring us some figgy pudding,
Now bring us some figgy pudding,
And a cup of good cheer
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year
(Choir)
We won't go until we've got some,
We won't go until we've got some,
We won't go until we've got some,
So bring it out here
Good tidings we bring for you and your
kin
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
