It's gonna take a miracle to make you stay this time
Nothing I could care to say could ever change your mind
Though silently, there's a part of me, that wants to let you go
Call it my mistake, if that's what it takes
With time you'll learn what I already know
When the world is not enough
Come back to me
When your dreams have lost their touch
Come back to me
When you're tired of chasing rainbows, that never do end
And nothing in this world is good enough
Just come back to me again

What we have is everything
In love there's nothing more
In my own experience, of that I feel so sure
Baby secretly, there's a side of me, that wants to set you free
I will pay the price, gladly sacrifice
If that's what I must do to make you see
When the world is not enough
Come back to me
When your dreams have lost their touch
Come back to me
When you're tired of chasing rainbows, that never do end
And nothing in this world is good enough
Just come back to me again
Oh Babyâ€¦
When you're tired of chasing rainbows, that never do end
When you realise that paradise has slipped through your hands
You can spend your whole life searching
You won't find this again
When nothing in this world is good enough
Turn around boy, come back into my life
