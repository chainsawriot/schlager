English translation:
You Got Me Used To
You got me used to
All of those things,
And you taught me
How wonderful they are.
Subtly you came to me like a temptation
Filling with anxiety my heart.
I didn't understand how love could be
In your strange world
And because of you I learned.
For that reason I wonder
Realizing you forgot me
Why you didn't teach me
How does one live without you.
For that reason I wonder
Realizing you forgot me

How does one live without you.
Why you didn't teach me
How does one live without you.
Why you didn't teach me
How does one live without you.
