It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control
I remember doing the time warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the voise would be calling
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's so dreamy

Oh fantasy free me
So you can't see me, no not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded
I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You've spaced out of sensation
Like you're under sedation.
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Well I was walking down the street just having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, He took me by surprise
He had a pick up truck and the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
