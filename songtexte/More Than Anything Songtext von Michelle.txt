Your love is like sunshine
Through my window
Throwing me a life line
Showing me the way
Your love is like a new dawn
After the night time
Simple words can not describe
How you move me deep inside
It's more than everything
The magic I feel
When we touch
Much more than energy
Like flying with angels above
It's amazing baby
Truly astounding
More than anything
More than everything
Is your love

Your love is like a warm breeze
Fresh off the ocean
I can feel your heartbeat
Dancing with mine
Your body told me when we're kissing
Does real emotion
Come and overwhelm me
Blowing my mind
I believe it endlessly
You're a miracle to me
It's more than everything
The magic I feel
When we touch
Much more than energy
Like flying with angels above
It's amazing baby
Truly astounding
More than anything
More than everything
(Is your love)
Real words can never show
How much you've changed my life
But I'd really rather try
I wanna try
It's more than everything
The magic I feel
When we touch
Much more than energy
Like flying with angels above
It's amazing baby
Truly astounding
More than anything
More than everything
Yeah yeah yeah
