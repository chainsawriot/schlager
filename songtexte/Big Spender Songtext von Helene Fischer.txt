The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of distinction,
A real Big Spender,
good looking, so refined.
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going im my mind?
So let me get right to the point,
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see,
Hey Big Spender,
spend a little time with me.

Wouldn't you like
to have fun? Fun? Fun?
How's about a few laughs? Laughs?
I can show you a good time, good time, good time
The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of distinction,
A real Big Spender,
Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender,
spend a little time with me.
Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender,
spend (uhuh) a little time with me
