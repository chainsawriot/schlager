I still remember what it was like the first time at 17 years old
In our little tent at the Baggersee
The pictures were still black and white
A bed in the cornfield, raspberry ice cream
In the Beetle to Paris on a coffee
The first kiss while bottle spinning
Going for a swim in the moonlight was so nice
Come on let it happen again
Yes I want to ride with you on the beach on white horses
Yes, I want to be wild and crazy like in the old days
I still have goose bumps in my stomach
Because it's the biggest thing you love me
I lie awake in your arm
And remember how it started
Memory paints sunsets in the night

We were young and carefree
The whole world has heard us and clouds have just laughed away
I have not regretted a day
I go with you through joy and sorrow, no matter how far
until the end of time
Yes I want to ride with you on the beach on white horses
Yes, I want to be wild and crazy like in the old days
I still have goose bumps in my stomach
Because it's the biggest thing you love me
Yes, I want to make love to you in the drive-in cinema
Yes, I want to wake up with you every new day
I still have goose bumps in my stomach
Because it's the biggest thing you love me
Yes I do
