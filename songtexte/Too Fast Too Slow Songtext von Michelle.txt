I couldn't get you
Just like a shooting star
Then slipped through my fingers
It's a road too far
Why did I falter
Why did I lose my ground
I'm a fish out of water, now that your not around
How could I mend what's all said and done
How could I be so wrong
I'm running too fast and too slow
Moving too high and too low
But I can't seem to find a way to get it right
I'm going over and under
So is it really any wonder
That I can't seem to find a way to get it right

The odds are against me, and I'm running out of time
Chasing the shadows of a dream I'll never find
Got too much to lose, I can't walk away
That's just the price I pay
I'm running too fast and too slow
Moving too high and too low
But I can't seem to find a way to get it right
I'm going over and under
So is it really any wonder
That I can't seem to find a way to get it right
So now, I will go and stand and fight
I'll find the strength and hold on with all of my mite
I'm running too fast and too slow
Moving too high and too low
But I can't seem to find a way to get it right
I'm going over and under
So is it really any wonder
That I can't seem to find a way to get it right
