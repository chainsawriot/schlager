Mmmmmh ooooh ooooooh
In days gone by we used to go
To rundown coffee shop
We'd laugh and sing the night away
You would listen, I would talk
And then gone were the nights, were the days
They were gone forever
We had plans, we had schemes, we had us
But it wouldn't last, oh no
Were we only dreamers in a dreamer's world
Only dreamers, thought we owned the world
When we started our song we thought the world would sing along
Were we only young, so full of hope and dreams
When you're young then you believe in things
If we meet again now would we see
We forgot to dream

Our hearts were full of sentiments
And our lives were full of life
We saw the wrong and talked about
All the ways we'd make things right
Would we still have the want, have the need
Now to make the changes
We had plans, we had schemes, we had us
But it wouldn't last, oh no no
Were we only dreamers in a dreamer's world
Only dreamers, thought we owned the world
When we started our song we thought the world would sing along
Were we only young so full of hope and dreams
When you're young then you believe in things
If we meet again now would we see
We forgot to dream
Were we only dreamers in a dreamer's world
Only dreamers, thought we owned the world
When we started our song we thought the world would sing along
Were we only young so full of hope and dreams
When you're young then you believe in things
If we meet again now would we see
We forgot to dream
