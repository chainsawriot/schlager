Don't know why memories seem to pass me by
Broken the wings of a butterfly when you said goodbye
Late at night you're not here but it's alright
Now I seem to love you more since you closed the door
And you'll be moving on to places I would love to go
But you can't get back you can't get back to me
And you'll be moving on to places we would love to go
But you can't get back you can't get back to me
Let him without sin cast the first stone
I'll guarantee you this you'll stand alone
Let him without sin cast the first stone
Right or wrong I just needed to belong
These emotions carried on until you came along
Do we keep living a lie promises that we make until we die

Let him without sin cast the first stone
I'll guarantee you this you'll stand alone
Let him without sin cast the first stone
And you can't get back you can't get back to me
And you'll be moving on to places I would love to go
But you can't get back you can't get back to me
And you'll be moving on to places we would love to go
But you can't get back you can't get back to me
Let him without sin cast the first stone
I'll guarantee you this you'll stand alone
Let him without sin cast the first stone
And you can't get back you can't get back to me
Let him without sin cast the first stone
I'll guarantee you this you'll stand alone
Let him without sin cast the first stone
And you can't get back you can't get back to me
