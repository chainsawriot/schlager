Now we have been through the harvest
Winter has truly begun
Now we have walked in the chill of the night
We are waiting for, waiting for
For the Saviour's Day
Many have come from the valleys
Many have come from the hills
Many have started their journey home
To be with someone, with someone
On the Saviour's Day
Open your eyes on Saviour's Day
Don't look back or turn away
Life can be your's if you'll only stay
He is calling you, calling you
On the Saviour's Day

Joining the old and the young ones
Joining the black and the white
Meeting the need of the hungry is he
Will we ever remember him
On the Saviour's Day
Open your eyes on Saviour's Day
Don't look back or turn away
Life can be your's if you'll only stay
He is calling you, calling you
On the Saviour's Day

Here's to the God of the present
(Raise your glasses)
Here's to the God of the past
(Drink to the King)
Here's to the hope in the future he brings
We will sing to Him, sing to Him
On the Saviour's Day
Open your eyes on Saviour's Day
Don't look back or turn away
Life can be your's if you'll only stay
He is calling you, calling you
On the Saviour's Day
On the Saviour's Day
On the Saviour's Day
On the Saviour's Day
On the Saviour's Day
(Calling, calling, calling you)
On the Saviour's Day
(Calling, calling, calling you)
On the Saviour's Day
fade out
