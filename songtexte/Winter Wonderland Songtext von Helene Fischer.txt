sleybells ring
i'll listening
in the ley
snow is glizzning
a beautyful sight
we're happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland
gone away
is the blue bird
here to stay

i sing a love song
when we drams alone
wolking in a winter wonderland
in the matter we can build the snowman
and we tell it he's pass anround
He say are you ready, we say no man
but you can do the job when you're in town
Aydorall

as we dream
by a fire
to face on a fried
that's what we make
walking in a winter wonderland
in the matter we can build a snowman
and we tell that he's a circles cloud
we'll have lots of fun with Mr snowman
and till the other kids knokt him down
when it's snow

with from we can play
they ask him away
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
