The last sunbeam of the day
Stroking my skin
A warm feeling of well-being
Deep inside me
The colors of my soul
Draw your face - so familiar!
I can feel it
I'll be right next to you
A spark of my song
I was only singing it for you
Firewind - Backwind
We take off!
With you around the world
High up to the sky tent
Let us all see miracles
And fly
With you around the world
Have the luck for us ordered
Give me your hand - hold on tight

And flee with me
A sunbath, a starry rain
A touch of bliss
No mountain is too high for us
No way too far
Through space and time, mindless
We are forever one
I'll show you my world
Come ready
A spark of my song
I was only singing it for you
Firewind - Backwind
We take off!
With you around the world
High up to the sky tent
Let us all see miracles
And fly
With you around the world
Have the luck for us ordered
Give me your hand - hold on tight
And flee with me
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Let us all see miracles
And fly
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Give me your hand - hold on tight
And flee with me
With you around the world
