I look in your eyes and I know what is wrong
It's always the same again
The moments we have are shared and gone
I wish that it all would end
The thought of you leaving is always there
It's maybe, maybe not
And for once I just can not go on
Leave me or come love me with all of your heart
Only half is not enough to call it love, it's now or never
Leave me or please promise me all that you've got
If you give me all your time
We'll let the world pass by

A day without you, a night with no love
I'm longing for your embrace
I give you my all but all that I get
Is only second place
And how can I carry on like this it's tearing me apart
Will you stay, will you go with your heart
Leave me or come love me with all of your heart
Only half is not enough to call it love, it's now or never
Leave me or please promise me all that you've got
If you give me all your time
We'll let the world pass by
Leave me or come love me with all of your heart
Only half is not enough to call it love, it's now or never
Leave me or please promise me all that you've got
If you give me all your time
We'll let the world pass by
If you give me all your time
We'll let the world pass by
