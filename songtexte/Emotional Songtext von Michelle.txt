Sometimes I get emotional
Sometimes I do some stupid things
Sometimes I say what I should just keep inside
Sometimes I'm sad, about everything
Sometimes I'm mad, and break something
Sorry times ten, but you just got in the way
Don't give up now, running away
I won't hurt you
Sometimes I'm just a pain
And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am
Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you
Laughing's always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared you'll leave me
That's when I feel,
Emotional

You say I'm just, impossible
Totally, unpredictable
I'm just a girl, get used to it
No big deal
You can't change me
Why would you try
I'm no angel, but I can make you smile
And that's the way it is
And that's just the way I am
Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you
Laughing's always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared you'll leave me
That's when I feel.
Emotional
Don't give up now, running away
I won't hurt you
Sometimes I'm just a pain
And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am
Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you
Laughing's always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared you'll leave me
That's when I feel
Sometimes I get,
Emotional
